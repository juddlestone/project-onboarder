# Project Onboarder
This repository captures my project requirements in a `json` data format, then creates and configures the necessary baseline set of infrastructure for me in a standardized manner. Giving me more time to focus of tinkering, learning and experimenting, and less time configuring identities, authentication, resource groups and permissions.

## What does it deploy?
A repository, with a branch for each specified environment. Ensuring 'main' is used for any 'PRD' environments.
