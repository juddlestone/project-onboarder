# Project Onboarder
This repository captures my project requirements in a `json` format, and creates and configures the necessary baseline set of infrastructure for me in a standardized manner. Giving me more time to focus of tinkering, learning and experimenting, and less time configuring identities, authentication, resource groups and permissions.
